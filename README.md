A playground of focused Rust experiments. Small, clear, practical.
Made with love with Rust ❤️

## 📘 What is this

Rust Labs is a collection of self-contained labs, each exploring a single Rust concept in isolation.
Think ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, traits, iterators, error handling, concurrency — all broken down into bite-sized experiments.

The goal is simple: minimal programs that teach by doing. Break things. Fix things. Internalize how Rust really works.

## 🧪 Labs

Each lab includes:

* A brief concept explanation
* Minimal example code
* Notes on lessons, trade-offs, and “aha” moments

| Concept                     | Directory               | Focus                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ownership & Moves           | `labs/ownership-moves/` | How values move, copy, and drop; why some types copy implicitly and others don’t |
| Borrowing & References      | `labs/borrowing/`       | Shared `&T` vs mutable `&mut T`; aliasing rules and compiler restrictions        |
| Lifetimes (Intro)           | `labs/lifetimes-basic/` | What lifetimes represent and why they exist; minimal examples                    |
| Pattern Matching            | `labs/patterns/`        | Destructuring, guards, match arms, irrefutable/refutable patterns                |
| Traits & Generics           | `labs/traits-generics/` | Custom traits, trait bounds, generics, type inference quirks                     |
| Error Handling              | `labs/errors/`          | `Result`, `?`, custom error enums, mapping functions                             |
| Iterators                   | `labs/iterators/`       | Custom iterators, adapters, lazy evaluation, data flow                           |
| Concurrency                 | `labs/concurrency/`     | Threads, channels, shared-state synchronization, early async experiments         |
| Modules & Project Structure | `labs/modules/`         | Visibility, module trees, file layout, crate structure                           |

More labs can be added over time: async/await, smart pointers, unsafe code, design patterns, and more.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Pick a lab.
2. Run the code.
3. Break it. Fix it. Modify it.
4. Take notes on what clicked — the “aha” moments matter more than code that just runs.

Labs are small — finish one in under two hours. Deep enough to build real intuition.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Rust mastery comes from mental models, not just syntax. These labs give you hands-on experience that sticks. Perfect for personal learning, creating future guides, or teaching others.
